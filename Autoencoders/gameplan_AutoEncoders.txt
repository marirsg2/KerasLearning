=====================================================================

FIRST
@Talk to Rao about your idea.


IMPORTANT CHANGES NEEDED: The source and target images confusion for different options. Like True to Noisy !! need the target image too.
target_img = Input(shape=(28,28,1))
UPDATE the loss functions to match that

True to Noisy and lower reward may combat each other !! Especially if negative reward. Or maybe working in tandem. need xp.
I think it will go against, because noisy image is to mislead, go in the wrong direction. But negative reward or less reward,
put into the error signal means it will either go in the right/different direction and SLOWER. slower may not be a bad thing.

NO NEED TO CHANGE loss function with the input output option. IF tRUE to noisy is the choice (I think) then the current
loss function is good. So it True to True, and noisy to noisy.
 <NOT NEEDED> But if Noisy to True, then the output(decoded) should be compared to the True value. BUT
 YOU WOULD ONLY WANT THIS, FOR HIGH REWARD CASES!! I.E. if the reward is high need to be able to reconstruct it.
 This could be useful, OR HAVE it as a preprocessing step to denoise. UNNECESSARY FOR NOW.


IMPORTANT
@MAYBE NEGATIVE reward is what causes noise. Because we want to FORGET that. So it would be TRUE to NOISE. Option 2


NOTE, your original error was SINGLE value for ALL pixels. Your modified error was an error for each pixel value.
NOT A FAIR comparison.
TRY BOTH:
Single error, vs Array Error. Codify the options.

INVERT THE IMAGE , BASED on the reward. That is the noise for B/W ? and draw attention.
So even 0 reward, matters, it gets COMPLETELY inverted. So feature extraction is more important.
Or NN dmay just learn when to invert.

<Write for later>
CAN ADD a reward LAYER / CHANNEL rather than just a single value. So the error is the crossentropy of the images
AFTER multiplying the reward with the input and output (or some other way). Thus a low or 0 reward region does not
contribute much. This allows specifying bounding boxes and assigning relative values.
<remember> the reward is not available during testing.


1) Add sparsity (flatten, fc layer, sparsity, reshape)
2)DO VIZ DOOM

REWARD-error and SPARSITY may work well ??

<WRITE DOWN> REWARD can be zero when TESTING

MNIST is not ideal due to high feature overlap across all cases, and how some 8s are written like 1s.
Even in basic vizdoom, the distinction is a little more clear. i.e. gun far away from monster, or near monster.

COLORIZATION FOR READABILITY. HUMAN Interpretable.
Could use blue and red for colored reconstruction !! All low reward images go to blue. All high reward goes to RED


Stacked Autoencoder ? with CNN style.. Hmmm... write for later

EXPERIMENT
CAN you feed a partly recovered image repeatedly , and see if the number is recovered from it ??
EASIER experiment.  THIS IS KINDA EM. MAYBE makes sense wrt to preferences too.
Train on 4 and 7.
