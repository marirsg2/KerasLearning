There are only 39 positive samples

0) I still think first order is to ehance resolution of AE

1) Training with negative samples as positive ones, seemed to work.

2) ADADELTA seemed to work over sgd. Was it luck and the right batch size to capture the signal
        I THINK it was having enough positive and negative samples !!

        Maybe for every mini batch, it unravels the signals better. ?? VERY UNSURE

3) WAIT !! instead of negative reward, what about NON-neg (Abs) reward WITH NOISING.
    So partial features that could have given positive reward will still be captured !!
