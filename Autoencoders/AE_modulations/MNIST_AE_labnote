AVERAGING(hazing) vs NOISING. for lower reward !! COMPARE, both are valid

EXAMPLE:
dict_num_reward = {0:0,     1:-0.3,    2:0,    3:0,    4:-0.3,    5:0,    6:0,    7:0,    8:1,  9:0}
THEN we see that 0,3,9 it sees as close to 8 (Similar features, INTENDED) with and we dont want 3s
dict_num_reward = {0:0,     1:-0.3,    2:0,    3:-1,    4:-0.3,    5:0,    6:0,    7:0,    8:1,  9:0}

Try to reload model, and then retrain with new weights.
