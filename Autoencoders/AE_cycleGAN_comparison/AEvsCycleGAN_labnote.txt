Im guessing some of the haziness is unavoidable due to upsampling. End of story. BUT given the number of channels,
MAYBE we can have enough information to make it work.

OR reduce the upsampling.

IMPROVE ACCURACY
1) After training, filter the images that have the highest reproduction, these are probably the easiest and simplest
images. Focus on these in training to get more accuracy with a smaller network.

2) TEST WITH NET'S BEST IMAGE AE
to see if your loss function was incorrect
