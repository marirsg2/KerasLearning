EXPERIMENTS

Try coding the replay minus training, by loading all weights.
====================================================================+
QUESTIONS

-1) YOUR ARRAY ERROR WAS SET TO BINARY CROSS ENTROPY !! FIX IT AND RETRY your array error. curiosity to understanding

-0.5) RETRY LINEAR

0) Averaging and maxing may COMPRESS the information to higher order components

1) Try MORE iterations for harder numbers (see the error)
and more epochs per iter when it can drop

0.5) Does the number of "features" in the image affect number of hidden units needed.
eg: 4 has 2 points for each line, and each point needs x and y.
Then the number of variations require more information. eg: slant, sizes, etc.



2) What are the single hidden node values for different 8's. Print on figures
For the different levels of the AE.

3) Try the CASCADED resnet !!

====================================================================+

DONE:

0) The negative numbers show up as white too !!

1) Try tanh, Try linear activation funciton
ANS: tanh worked ok. Linear did not.

2) I think the max pool and upsample steps making the piece wise approach worse
