QUESTIONS


WHAT youre doing is stupid, you are asking the subsequent networks to PRESERVE THE ERROR !! RATHER THAN CORRECT.
the true image reference is lost. In subsequent layers, you want to ADD the previous input and try to match the
TRUE output. So the input is not the ERROR, but the TRUE image, yes INPUT, the output is then ADDED with the previous inputS (yes
more than 1 input, the compound), and then compared with the true error.

-1) YOUR ARRAY ERROR WAS SET TO BINARY CROSS ENTROPY !! FIX IT AND RETRY your array error. curiosity to understanding

-0.5) RETRY LINEAR

!!!) I think for the stacked approach to work, the error needs to be back propagated through the inputs to the
prev versions of the stack too. So each intermediate output has 2 error signals, the comparison with the previous input,
and the error through the forward layers.
THIS may allow SINGLE HIDDEN NODES.  ?? do we (at each output) sum all previous outputs and compare with the original- YES !!
I think so.

0) Averaging and maxing may COMPRESS the information to higher order components

1) Try MORE iterations for harder numbers (see the error)
and more epochs per iter when it can drop

0.5) Does the number of "features" in the image affect number of hidden units needed.
eg: 4 has 2 points for each line, and each point needs x and y.
Then the number of variations require more information. eg: slant, sizes, etc.



2) What are the single hidden node values for different 8's. Print on figures
For the different levels of the AE.

3) Try the CASCADED resnet !!

0) The negative numbers show up as white too !!

1) I think the max pool and upsample steps making the piece wise approach worse

2) More layers and channels in the conv layers lets you do MORE with the values.
interpret/divide it more, especially if you have >1 hidden value.
