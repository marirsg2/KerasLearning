Basic now works with adadelta 5,10. The image was cropped.

Try changing code to allow CONTINUED TRAINING. sAVE AND restore model weights. A secondary option
to TRAIN MODEL is RESTORE MODEL.


2) (@) Add a penalty to adjacent pixels being the same or very close.

3) (@) WAIT !! instead of negative reward, what about NON-neg (Abs) reward WITH NOISING.
    So partial features that could have given positive reward will still be captured !!

5) Other tricks ? Batch norm , regularizers ?


===========DATA====================

0)! Adadelta worked after removing one fc layer. Seems like the memory restriction affects how large the model can be.

0.5) ! adadelta on 148 seems to somewhat figure the monster. I think with DFC it will be much better

1) There are only 39 positive samples. NO, this was incorrect , due to bad sampling

1.5) sgd and adagrad work in regular image reconstruction. sgd worse than adagrad which atleast learns patches. Rmsprop seems to work as well as adadelta

2) Adadelta does not work with 148x148 for regular image reconstruction ?because the validation set is too large.

3) ADADELTA seemed to work for AE filtering. Was it luck and the right batch size to capture the signal
        I THINK it was having enough positive and negative samples !!
        adadelta with batch size 5, and 10 epochs worked
        Maybe for every mini batch, it unravels the signals better. ?? VERY UNSURE

4) SGD seemed to learn a black image for 100x100 and 148x148 ?? is it because batch size 25 does not work. Does SGD even take batch size ?
  TRY with batch size = 1
