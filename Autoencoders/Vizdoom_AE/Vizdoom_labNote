There are only 39 positive samples

1) Training with negative samples as positive ones, seemed to work.

2) ADADELTA seemed to work over sgd. Was it luck and the right batch size to capture the signal

3) WAIT !! instead of negative reward, what about NON-neg (Abs) reward WITH NOISING.
    So partial features that could have given positive reward will still be captured !!
